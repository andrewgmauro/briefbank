This is an (unfinished) Vue/Express/MySQL web app for organizing and searching legal briefs and trial testimony. Even today, many law offices are very dependent on paper-based filing systems. Having a system that would allow them to access their catalogue of data would both expedite the office's workflow as well as the quality of their advocacy.
Currently the MySQL database is populated with the name, date, indictment #, and file location of a small collection of searchable PDF files. The app can accept queries to this database through the Node terminal.
In the future, I plan on finishing the front-end of this app to handle queries of this data. I also plan on creating a secure login and upload system for individual offices to manage their data securely.
